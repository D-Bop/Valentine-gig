                    Funny how our conversation started with "you look like metro too much". It's been all fun and vibes since then and even though it's still early too say, I'm glad I have you as a friend and I find you and your personality quite interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really want and hope this grows to be something beautiful we'd look back at and let out huge smiles on our faces. Till then, let's cherish the moment's we've had and make even more beautiful ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really want to thank you for spending time with me though. I enjoy your prescence alot even when there's nothing to ta`lk about.

                    But not as bright as you do.

                I was thinking of what to get you and something told me to write a code for you since it's more economical for me and you might find it sweet <br>
